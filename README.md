# TranscriptToHTML
Google Apps Script to convert podcast transcripts to HTML.

To add this script to an existing transcript Google doc:
1. Go to Tools > Script editor.
2. Paste the contents of transcripttohtml.js (in this repo) into the editor.
3. Ctrl-s to save.
4. Go back to document and go to Add-on > Transcript to HTML > Run.
5. Authorize the app if it's your first time using it. When it warns you that the app is not from Google, just move forward by selecting Advanced to proceed.
6. The script runs and when it's done you should have an email with the HTML attached! (at the gmail you are logged in with)
